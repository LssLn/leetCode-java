<h1>0009 - palindromeNumber</h1>
Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.<br>

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.<br>

For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.<br>
 
<br>
Example 1:<br>

Input: x = 121<br>
Output: true<br>
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.<br><br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: x = -121<br>
Output: false<br>
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.<br><br>
Example 3:<br>

Input: x = 10<br>
Output: false<br>
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.<br>
 <br>

Constraints:<br>

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1
