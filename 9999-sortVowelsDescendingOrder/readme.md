Sort vowels descending order<br>
<br>
<b>Challenge</b><br>
Implement a Java class with two methods:<br>

<b>main</b> method that reads a string as input and prints the output in the console<br>
<b>sortVowels</b> that takes a string as argument and returns the same string with sorted vowels<br>
The sortVowels is implementing the algorithm that sorts the vowels (a-e-i-o-u) of the input string in descending order. 
<br>This method should keep the consonants in the same position as the input string. 
<br>If there are no vowels in the input string, the method must return the original string.<br>

Examples<br>
cat		--> 	cat<br>
rule	-->		rule<br>
pain	-->		pian<br>
plane	-->		plena<br>
aeiou	-->		uoiea<br>
assertion	-->	ossirtean<br>
